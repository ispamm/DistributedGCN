# Distributed Training of Graph Convolutional Networks

This is a basic example of the training procedure used in the paper:

S. Scardapane; I. Spinelli, P. Di Lorenzo [Distributed Training of Graph Convolutional Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9303371), *IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks*, 2021.

### Installation

To install all required dependencies run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run
The "self-contained" notebook shows the distributed training for the task of node classification on CoRa.
